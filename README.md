# Goonwood
Gloomwood buttplug.io integration

## Notice
This mod is not yet finished, we have a few requirements before we can release our first build.

- Extensive play testing has to be done in the development stages

Some features remain unimplemented.

- Vibration upon healing
- Vibration upon firing guns
- Vibration upon receiving damage and death
- In-game config editing
  - Might want to make a separate library for others to use too.
- An actual config file.

Although, some features are implemented. Which at the time of writing (June 3rd, 2024) is vibrating while you're detected by enemies.

## Building
remind me...
